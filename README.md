# Robot Friends

This React application allows you to search for your robot friends by name.  Quickly and easily find the perfect metallic companion using our intuitive search interface.

## How it Works

The app displays a list of robot friends, each with their own profile information (e.g., image, name, and other details).  A search bar is provided, allowing users to type in a name or part of a name.  As you type, the list of robots dynamically filters to show only those whose names match your search query.
